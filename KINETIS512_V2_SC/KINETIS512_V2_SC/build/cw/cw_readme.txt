General directions for all CodeWarrior projects:

1. Set the workspace directory to the "KINETIS_100MHz_Rev2_release\release" folder location. These projects use workspace relative paths, so in order for the project to find all files correctly the CW10.3 workspace must be set to "KINETIS_100MHz_Rev2_release\release" folder (the one that contains the build and src directories).
